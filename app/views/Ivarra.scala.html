          <h1>Elliot Ivarra</h1>
          <p>Elliot Ivarra, 16, was born in Saint Martin, but lives in Saint Barthelemy Island.French surfer Elliot Ivarra today won the European final of the Quiksilver King of the Groms in 3 feet fun waves at Ericeira, Portugal. The young french surfer had won his ticket for the Quiskslver King Of the Groms Euro Final thanks to his first place in trials yesterday. This place allowed him to compete in the main event. In Ericeira, the Frenchman ruled this final heat of competition with several backside tricks scoring to fun waves 5.83 pts then a last one 7.43 pts for a final score of 13.50 pts. His domination upon Europe's best 16 and under surfers was unquestionable even if the young French kid Nomme Mignot battled hard for the crown until the very last seconds of the heat. As he was leading the final, Nomme, from Surfing French Team, let Elliot the victory. None the less, both of them will fly to France to take part to the Quiksilver King of the Groms International final to be held during the Quiksilver Pro France - an ASP World Tour event- (From September 27th to October 8th) gathering the world's best surfers on the Landes coast. An extraordinary experience for these two groms.
